            In the latest midnight hour
            When the world has gone to sleep
            You gotta get up
            When doubts begin to rise
            And the world is at your feet
            You gotta get up
            
            Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
            I cleanse in the river for somebody else
            For anyone but myself
            
            I'm not a selfless man
            I'm not a man of wealth
            If I had all the world
            Probably give it to myself
            But the trees begin to walk
            And the ground begins to talk
            And myself
            
            Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
            I cleanse in the river for somebody else
            For anyone but myself
            
            Hold my place
            Don't you give up on me
            Hold on, hold on
            
            Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
            (Love doesn't come to you give it up)
            (Love doesn't come to you give it up)
            I cleanse in the river for somebody else
            (Love doesn't come to you give it up)
            (Love doesn't come to you give it up)
            For anyone but myself
            Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
            (Love doesn't come to you give it up)
            (Love doesn't come to you give it up)
            I cleanse in the river for somebody else
